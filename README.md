# Janina Meyer-Amundsen | Frontend Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio project — a one-page site built to showcase my work, background, and personality as a frontend developer-in-training. This project is part of the course at Noroff and is designed using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on accessibility, design, and performance.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is fully responsive and highlights some of the key projects I've completed during my studies. It includes:
- A custom hero/intro section
- Project showcase with links to live demos and GitHub repos
- About me section
- Contact section with external links
- Smooth scrolling, dynamic footer year, and scroll animations

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to present my skills, reflect my design taste, and act as a digital introduction to who I am | not just what I can build. It's both a technical exercise and a personal expression.

##  Built With

- HTML
- CSS (with variables, media queries, and semantic layout)
- JavaScript (modular, external file)
- No frameworks | fully handcrafted 

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main page
- `style.css` – Global styles
- `script.js` – JavaScript functionality
- `images/` – Assets used on the site

## What I Would Improve

This is a living project, and I already have ideas for what I’d improve:
- Possibly integrating a CMS or API-driven blog section in the future
- Building in more subtle microinteractions
